These are bed STLs for slicers that support them, IE Prusa/Orca/SuperSlicer.

They are only a nice to have, and may help to orientate parts correctly on the build-plate, shoukd you want to show off/setup a timelapse.

I don't know how to embed photos in here, but there are .PNG images to show you what it looks like in this repo.
