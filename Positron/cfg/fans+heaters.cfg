[temperature_sensor MCU]
sensor_type: temperature_mcu
sensor_mcu: mcu
#   The micro-controller to read from. The default is "mcu".
#sensor_temperature1:
#sensor_adc1:
#   Specify the above two parameters (a temperature in Celsius and an
#   ADC value as a float between 0.0 and 1.0) to calibrate the
#   micro-controller temperature. This may improve the reported
#   temperature accuracy on some chips. A typical way to obtain this
#   calibration information is to completely remove power from the
#   printer for a few hours (to ensure it is at the ambient
#   temperature), then power it up and use the QUERY_ADC command to
#   obtain an ADC measurement. Use some other temperature sensor on
#   the printer to find the corresponding ambient temperature. The
#   default is to use the factory calibration data on the
#   micro-controller (if applicable) or the nominal values from the
#   micro-controller specification.
#sensor_temperature2:
#sensor_adc2:
#   If sensor_temperature1/sensor_adc1 is specified then one may also
#   specify sensor_temperature2/sensor_adc2 calibration data. Doing so
#   may provide calibrated "temperature slope" information. The
#   default is to use the factory calibration data on the
#   micro-controller (if applicable) or the nominal values from the
#   micro-controller specification.

[temperature_sensor Host_Pi]
sensor_type: temperature_host
sensor_path: /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
#   The path to temperature system file. The default is
#   "/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp" which is the temperature
#   system file on a Raspberry Pi computer.
